# Pokemon Memory Game

Challenge your memory with this engaging and fun Pokémon-themed memory game! Click on each Pokémon without repeating to score points. Can you remember them all?

## Description
This interactive game, built with React, tasks players to click on Pokémon cards without selecting the same one twice. With each click, the cards shuffle around, making the game more challenging. It's not just about memory, but also about keen observation as you progress through the rounds!

##Features:
Dynamic Pokémon Cards: The game fetches Pokémon data from the pokeapi.co to display a set of random Pokémon cards.

Shuffling Mechanism: Cards shuffle with every click to challenge your memory further.

Scoring System: Players earn a point for every unique Pokémon they click. The game keeps track of the current score and the top score in a session.

Round Counter: As an added feature, the game indicates the current round, letting players know how far they've progressed in the set of 12 Pokémon.

Modal Display: On selecting a repeated Pokémon, a modal pops up displaying the player's score for that round.

Responsive Design: The game layout is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly across various device sizes.

##How to Play:
Start the game by clicking on any Pokémon card.
Continue clicking different Pokémon cards, but remember which ones you've already clicked!
With each click, the cards will shuffle.
If you click the same Pokémon twice in a round, the game will end, and your score will be displayed.
Challenge yourself to beat your top score!
